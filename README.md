#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

- **var** is function scoped and can be redeclared or hoisted, **let** and **const** are block scoped. **let** can change its value , while **const** stays constant once set.

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 
- **forEach()** just loops.
- **map()** returns a new array of changed values.
- **filter()** returns a new array of matching values.  

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
- **Arrow functions** are a shorter way to write functions in ES6.  

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
- **Destructuring** lets you extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a concise and readable way. 

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
- Template literals let you embed variables and expressions directly inside backticks (`) using ${}. They’re cleaner than string concatenation because you don’t need + and can also span multiple lines easily.
